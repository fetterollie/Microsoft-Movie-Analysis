## Overview

A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

## Business Problem

Summary of the business problem you are trying to solve, and the data questions that you plan to answer in order to solve them.

***
Questions to consider:
* What are the business's pain points related to this project?
* How did you pick the data analysis question(s) that you did?
* Why are these questions important from a business perspective?
***

## Data

Describe the data being used for this project.

***
Questions to consider:
* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?
***

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
***

Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:

### Visual 1

## Conclusions

Provide your conclusions about the work you've done, including any limitations or next steps.

***
Questions to consider:
* What would you recommend the business do as a result of this work?
* What are some reasons why your analysis might not fully solve the business problem?
* What else could you do in the future to improve this project?
